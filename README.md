# ➡️ Keylogger.

This Python program implements a keylogger, which is a type of software that records the keystrokes made by a user on their computer. The program was developed as part of the My Cyber Security project for the IBM SkillsBuild Internship. It utilizes the pynput library to monitor and capture key events. Each key event is stored in a list called key_list, which is later converted to JSON format and saved to a file named 'logs.json'. The keylogger differentiates between key press, key hold, and key release events.

Keyloggers can be used for various purposes, including cybersecurity, digital forensics, and system monitoring. In the context of cybersecurity, keyloggers can be employed for legitimate purposes such as monitoring employee activities within an organization or detecting and preventing unauthorized access. However, it's important to note that the use of keyloggers can also raise serious privacy concerns and legal implications. It is crucial to ensure that the use of such tools complies with applicable laws and regulations and respects individuals' privacy rights.
